# Lab4-Business
## Project
The project is a Linux distribution designed for gaming. It will primarily be focused on optimization of a computer's resources in order to allow for fast and efficient use of resources to make gaming possible effectively on Linux. Software such as Wine, Steam, and PlayOnLinux will come standard with the installation of the operating system. A prime focus of the operating system would be to figure out the maximum compatability of Windows-based gaming software with the system, as Windows is currently the largest operating system used for gaming which most games are typically designed for. By figuring out a solution to this it will enable this operating system to be used by PC gamers everywhere with the benefits of a Linux operating system and the gaming possibilities of a Windows operating system.

## Business model
The business will use the Professional Services model, providing the software as free and open source but any services such as consulting, installation, priority support, or training with the software will require a fee. This is similar to Red Hat's business model, which is an excellent example of how open source software can be given feely yet the company that primarily owns it still makes money off of not just donations.

## License
The license for the project would be the Apache License 2.0 in order to preserve copyright/trademark and patent rights of the business while still enabling the community to contribute and make and use their own derivatives of the software. This allows for the business to successfully adhere to our business model while keeping to open source standards.
